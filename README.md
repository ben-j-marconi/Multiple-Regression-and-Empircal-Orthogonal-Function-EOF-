# Multiple-Regression-and-Empircal-Orthogonal-Function-EOF-
Multiple regression with three predictors and EOF analysis on multi-decadal Nino 3.4 Index data.

Data: 1951 to 2008, with the exception of Nino3.4 SST, which is provided for every month of each year. 

Variables are expressed as anomalies (departures from normal) with respect to some period average (not necessarily 1951-2008), so that the average of the anomalies is likely not equal to zero. Variables included: 

a. Atmospheric annual average CO2 concentration at Mauna Loa Observatory (ppm)
b. The year itself, to measure time (1951 to 2008)
c. Northern Hemisphere annual average temperature anomaly
d. Tropical annual average temperature anomaly
e. United States annual average temperature anomaly
f. Southern Hemisphere annual average temperature anomaly
g. Global annual average temperature anomaly (degrees C)
h. Tropical Pacific SST in the Nino3.4 region (degrees C); by month
